## REST API(s)

## Setup

### Clone from git repository

```
URL: https://github.com/khatri7/cs546-group36-final-project.git
```

### Installing dependencies

Install npm dependencies in both the `client` and `server` subdirectories and also the root directory using `npm install`.

```shell
> npm install
> cd server && npm install
> cd client && npm install
```

The root directory has been initialized as an npm project and installs [`concurrently`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) as a dev dependency to start both the client and the server with a single command

Set up a MongoDB database either locally or online via <a href='https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas'>MongoDB Atlas</a>

Create a `.env` file in both the `client` and `server` subdirectories as shown in the `.env.example` files

Set up the following environment variables

> In `client/.env`:

```ini
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:3005" //endpoint on which server will start
```

> In `server/.env`:

```ini
MONGO_URL= //MongoDB database endpoint
MONGO_DATABASE= //name of the database
JWT_SECRET= //string used for JWT secret
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME= //S3 bucket name
AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= //S3 bucket access key
AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID= //S3 bucked access key id
AWS_S3_REGION= //S3 region
ENVIRONMENT="local" //environment currently working on - used for storing media according to environment
```

### Run

Finally, to run the code, from the root directory you can start the application in development mode (with server hot reloading) using:

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

Or, use the start script:

```shell
$ npm start
```
